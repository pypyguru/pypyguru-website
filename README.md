## Motivation

I created this website to kickstart my journey into software development and share my knowledge and experiences with the world. The name "PyPyGuRu" came to me as I want to become a guru in Python programming, and it stuck with me since I bought the domain in July 2023. This site marks the official beginning of my journey into the world of programming ðŸš€.
